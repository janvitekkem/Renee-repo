Avoid processed foods, sugary snacks, and alcohol, which can all contribute to mood swings and make depression worse.
    </li>
    <li>    Getting enough sleep: Sleep is essential for overall health and well-being, and getting enough restful sleep can help reduce symptoms of depression. Try to establish a regular sleep routine and create a relaxing bedtime ritual to help you wind down and fall asleep more easily.
    </li>
    <li>    Self-care: Practicing self-care can help reduce stress and improve mood. This can include activities such as taking a warm bath, reading a book, or spending time in nature. It's important to prioritize self-care and make time for activities that make you feel good.
    </li>
    <li>    Social support: Connecting with others and building a support system can also be helpful for managing depression. This can include reaching out to friends or family members, joining a support group, or volunteering in your community.
